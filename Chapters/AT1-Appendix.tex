\section{Some Exercises}

\subsection{AT1Sheet1}

The first exercise is not strictly related to the content of the course, but it is nevertheless quite interesting.

\begin{exercise}[AT1Sheet1.1]\label{exercise:AT1Sheet1.1}
Let $X$ be a finite CW-complex and $Y$ a space such that for every basepoint $y\in Y$ and every number $i$ that is less than or equal to the dimension of $X$ the set $\pi_i(Y,y)$ is finite. Show that the set $[X,Y]$ of homotopy classes of maps from $X$ to $Y$ is finite.
